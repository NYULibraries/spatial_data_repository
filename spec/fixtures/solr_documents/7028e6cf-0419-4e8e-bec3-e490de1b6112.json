    "This data was created as part of a study that examined the accessibility to jobs by transit in 49 of the 50 largest (by population) metropolitan areas in the United States. It is the most detailed evaluation to date of access to jobs by transit, and it allows for a direct comparison of the transit accessibility performance of America's largest metropolitan areas. This data is part of a longitudinal study.",
    "Downloads are available for individual metropolitan regions, as well as states, in CSV or Shapefile format. Combined ZIP files containing the data for all metropolitan regions are also available in CSV and Shapefile format, and are labeled as \"All Metropolitan Regions.\" A combined ZIP file containing the data for all State regions is available only in CSV format."
