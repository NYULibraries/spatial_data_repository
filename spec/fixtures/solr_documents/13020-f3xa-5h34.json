    "The data set includes hypsographic data (area-at-depth) for over 750 Minnesota and Wisconsin lakes throughout the states. The majority of these lakes (650+) did not have publicly available hypsography. The hypsography was derived by digitizing bathymetric DNR maps using ImageJ. One hundred Minnesota lakes were selected that had DNR hypsographic data (in the form of a DEM) available and a comparison between the hypsographic data derived from DEMs and ImageJ was completed. These results, as well as code and hypsographic data is all available. The purpose of this work was to release broad scale lake area-at-depth data for limnological and aquatic biology studies.",
    "Minnesota_Hypsography is a folder containing csv files of hypsographic data from Minnesota lakes. Validation_Hypsography is a folder containing csv files of hypsographic data used for validation. Wisconsin_Hypsography is a folder containing csv files of hypsographic data from Wisconsin lakes. MN_bathy.rds is an R file with interpolated depth for a subset of lakes in Minnesota. Hypso_QC.r is an R file used for quality control purposes with hypsographic data that has been digitzed. Validation_report is an R file that has the comparisons between DNR derived hypsography and ImageJ derived hypsography."
