    "The data are provided in 4 ESRI shapefiles. The shapefiles are segmented by the analysis day of the week and departure time. The fields include the Census block-level 15-digit identifier (GEOID10), baseline accessibility, tier 1 managed lane scenario accessibility, their absolute difference, their percent difference. CRS EPSG: 4326 - WGS 84. Users should be able to map the cumulative job accessibility by automobile for 4 comparisons between baseline (general purpose lanes) and managed lanes (tier 1 corridors)."
