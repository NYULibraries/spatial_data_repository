  "dc_description_s": "This record contains aerial laser scanning (ALS) and photogrammetry data that corresponds to flight 190511_161348is one part of data that was collected over an area of about 0.5 kmÂ² in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, NY in April, 2019. Each flight line package includes one LiDAR Point Cloud file in LAZ format, two LiDAR Full waveform files in PulseWaves format, two LiDAR Full waveform files in LAS format, and a series of RGBI Nadir Imagery files in TIFF format. Future data releases will include 16 hyperspectral data files. In this 2019 Sunset Park collection, billions of laser points were acquired (inclusive of partially covered areas). ALS was carried out by contractors using a RIEGL LMS-Q680i LiDAR Scanner and an ITRES MicroCASI 1920 Hyperspectral Camera. The average flying altitude was approximately 1000 feet above groud level with a total of 85 flight paths. This data was harvested to obtain high accuracy models of the urban environment that can be used as a basis for urban informatics research and various practical applications, including digital mapping for auto navigation, pedestrian wind modeling, disability access optimization, and disaster mitigation. For full information on this data, consult the documentation and metadata. See the source dataset for a guide to the entire collection. A collection-level manifest of SHA-256 checksums is available in the nyu-2451-60458-manifest.json' file, within the preservation record.
